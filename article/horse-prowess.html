                    <p> Benchmarking the different browser engines, with <span style="color:#F0E15A;">JavaScript.</span> </p>
                        <br>
                    <h2> Premise </h2>
                    <p> If something can be done on <span style="color:#F0E15A;">JavaScript,</span> it will be. But how well does it run? Whilst building applications on JavaScript I somehow realised the obvious, different browsers have <span style="color:#F0E15A;">JavaScript</span> runtimes.
                        Well, okay, but how do they compare to something like <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #238737">Node?</span> And is it significant?
                        Let's create a snippet of code to compare the bunch; </p>
                        <br>
                    <img src="img/ErastoThenes.png" width="100%">
                    <h4> Sieve of Erastothenes! </h4>
                    <p> My favourite way of finding prime numbers. (mileage may vary) <br> Flow of the code is really simple, start a timer, get all of the primenumbers under 1 million natural numbers, stop the timer and call it a day. We also want to print out the last Prime number to validate all of the runs give the same, correct results. </p>
                    <p> I'll open the browsers and run the script above to find out the runtimes. To ease the margin of error a bit, let's run it five times and get their average. </p>
                    <h2 style="width: 90%;border-bottom: 2px solid #171B23;">Statistics</h2>
                    <p> Results are in. See them below;  </p>
                    <img src="img/table.png" width="100%">
                    <p> Unsuprisingly, looking at the average scores, there's not a lot of fluctuation. We can see two outliers from the 6 engines;
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;color:#89c1f5;">Internet Explorer</span>, which I tested to get a rough idea of the other results and
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #E24C27">Mozilla's FireFox</span>, which beat the othres by a long shot. </p>
                        <p> <br> Here's all of them arranged from slowest to fastest;</p> 
                        <img src="img/Results.png" width="100%">
                        <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #238737">Node</span> being second to last! At first this surprised me. How could a runtime for JavaScript, ran on a desktop machine be <strong> slower </strong></p>
                        <p> than all of the browser ones? </p>
                        <p> However, it does make sense. <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #238737">Node.js</span> is not meant to be a responsive, light weight component of a web-browser. Browsers must run the code as fast as they can with minimal bloat, otherwise they will feel slow and unresponsive.</p>
                        <p> The results show that  <span style="font-weight: bold;color:#89c1f5;">Internet Explorer</span> (unsuprisingly) is indeed ages slower than it's modern counterparts. The fact it is 3,700% slower than the fastest browser surely amounts for all of the memes made of <span style="font-weight: bold;color:#89c1f5;">IE's slowness.</span></p> 
                    
                    <h2 style="width: 90%;border-bottom: 2px solid #171B23;">Conclusions</h2>
                    <p> Some more context could be helpful. The Mozilla browser and it's engine are actually quite fast. </p>
                    <p> Same calculation on GoLang takes around 6 ms, so it's not actually meaningfully slower than Go. </p>
                    <p> I will have to dig in more to get a better idea why the engines vary so much in speed, but this was an interesting test none the less. </p>
                    <p>At the very least, we learned IE has long fell off, and Microsoft Edge is suprisingly competent alongside other modern browsers! </p>
