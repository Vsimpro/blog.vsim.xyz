                    <p> exploring a Meta- account phishing site. </p>

                    <h2> to note; </h2>
                    <p> This is no way to be mistaken for vigilantism or hacktivism. 
                        I intended not to exploit the site nor gain any value from said exploitation.
                        Everything done in this article has been done out of sheer curiosity and I can't really advise following in my footsteps.
                    </p> <br>
                    <h2 style="width: 90%;border-bottom: 2px solid #171B23"> .. and then to the fun stuff! </h2>
                    <br> <br>
                    <h2> "You've violated the copyright rules" </h2>
                    <p> is what I received on a message, on facebook. Now, while at face value it may seem plausible, the message itself gives it away pretty quickly. </p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="img/message.png" width="90%">
                    <p> I've censored some parts that could either be tied to me by the site owner. I've also censored the domain name. 
                    <i> Noteworthy, </i>the domain ends with ".xyz". An interviewer told me once after seeing my site, 
                    <br><span style="margin-left:2em"><quote>"That's got to be the first legitimate .xyz site I've ever seen."</quote></span><br>
                    What you'll also notice is the urgency of the first part of the message to get you to click the link. 
                    <br> So let's click it! Let's see what's behind it! 
                    <img src="img/index.png" width="90%"> <br>
                    To state the obvious; they're <i> impersonating </i>Meta and Instagram. These sites are often visually very, very close to the real thing
                    But internally, they're built with simply functionality in mind. It's not uncommon to find a XSS vulnerability from a site like this.
                    With usernames you can try to inject html and / or JavaScript into the name, as it's displaid on the site. Let's try that with the "strong" tag. 
                    <img src="img/notallowed.png" width="90%">
                    Suprisingly, they've actually thought about this, and do not allow the special characters. For some reason under 4 character names are not okay either.
                    We have no other choice but to play along. 
                    <img src="img/withoutinjection.png" width="90%"> <br>
                    It's at this point I start to notice the site is possibly vulnerable. If you take a look at the site, and
