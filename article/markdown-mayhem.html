                <h1>Markdown Mayhem in Disco-town.</h1>
                <p> Premise: <br>
                    Joking around on <span style="color: #E24C27">Discord</span> about how old one of our friend is, we stumbled upon a bug. 
                    If you had the year represented as a number and a dot after it (like 1784.) 
                    <span style="color: #E24C27">Discord</span> would do something interesting: the message would get rendered wrong. 
                    <img src="/article/img/FirstTouch.png"> <br>
                    What's going on?
                </p>
                <h3> What is Markdown? </h3>
                <p> To fully understand what's going on, we must understand what <span style="color:#89c1f5;">markdown</span> is. 
                    It's a lightweight markup language, designed for formatting text online. 
                    You might've seen it in use with <span style="color: #F0E15A">Github Readmes.</span> You can create headings, 
                    emphasize text through bolding or italic styling, you can create lists, hyperlinks.. 
                    sometimes more. <span style="color: #E24C27">Discord</span> introduced this feature in the <span style="color: #F0E15A">Spring of 2023</span>, enhancing
                    the text formatting capabilities of it's platform.
                </p>
                <h3> The Rendering Quirk. </h3>
                <p> 
                    Within <span style="color:#89c1f5;">markdown</span>, it's possible to create ordered lists that start from a specific number. 
                    For example, typing "1. First index" generates an ordered list in <span style="color:#89c1f5;">Markdown</span>, beginning from 1.
                    Smartest of you have already realised this seems familiar. When rendered on Discord, 
                    the <span style="color: #238737">HTML</span> generated looks like this: 
                    <br><img src="/article/img/GeneratedHTML.png"><br>
                    And the application renders the above like this: 
                    <br><img src="/article/img/GeneratedRender.png"><br>
                    Huh, that's <span style="color: #E24C27">interesting</span> -- it seems like the message is <i> flowing </i> outside of bounds.. what is going on?
                </p>
                <h3> The bugs origins. </h3>
                <p> 
                    So what's the issue with <span style="color: #E24C27">rendering?</span> We can see that in the <span style="color: #238737">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#89c1f5;">markdown</span> is marked as "::marker".
                    This is called a "selector", and it creates a pseudo-element to apply <span style="color: #F0E15A">CSS</span> specifically to this marker.
                    There lies our issue: within the <span style="color: #F0E15A">CSS</span>. The <span style="color: #F0E15A">CSS</span> causes the message to start from further left than it should.
                    What's interesting is, that the first character of the ordered lists index begins where the message normally begins:
                    the <span style="color: #F0E15A">CSS</span> <span style="color: #238737">pushes the message left</span> 1 character per 1 character in the <span style="color:#89c1f5;">"ordinal number."</span>
                </p>
                <h3> How far <span style="color: #E24C27">left</span> can we go? </h3>
                <p>
                    .. and I'm not here to discuss politics. Let's see how many 3's we can fit into <span style="color: #F0E15A">1337.</span> before something happens:
                    <br><img src="/article/img/1337s.png"><br>                
                    The limit seems to be at: <span style="color: #F0E15A">13333333337</span>, afterwhich Discord goes ahead and makes it start from 1 again.
                    Biggest number we can insert before it doing the same seems to be <span style="color:  #238737">2147483647</span>, 
                    which unsurprisingly is the maximum size of a <span style="color: #F0E15A">32-bit signed integer.</span> Not really useful knowledge to us, 
                    but this means Discord either stores or handles the ordinal numbers as integers, and allows them to be only
                    the size of a <span style="color: #F0E15A">32-bit int.</span> Anything bigger gets turned to -> <span style="color: #238737">1.</span>
                </p>
                <h3> How far can we push the bug? </h3>
                <p>
                    Here we get to the fun part: Chaining <span style="color:#89c1f5;">markdown.</span> With lists -- be they ordered or not -- you can use Markdown
                    inside the list element too. Meaning, you guessed it, we can create lists inside of lists.
                    So if the list <span style="color: #238737">number</span>  gets pushed to the <span style="color:#89c1f5;">left</span>, what happens if we have <span style="color: #F0E15A">two</span> of them?
                    <br><img src="/article/img/DiscordOverlap.png"> <br>
                    <span style="color: #E24C27">They overlap!</span> How fun! So how many can we overlap? Unfortunately with lists the number is 11. 
                    Here's what it looks like, using the max integer as the value:
                    <br><img src="/article/img/DiscordIntegerOverflow.png"><br>
                    What about other <span style="color:#89c1f5;">markdown</span>? What else can we add to the mix? Let's see headers. We can append "#" at the beginning,
                    to make the whole message one big heading. Or we can use ">" to make block quotes.
                    Here we see some of the bug manifest itself again, <span style="color: #E24C27">as the list pushes "through" the line:</span>
                    <br><img src="/article/img/ThroughShot.png"><br>
                
                </p>

                <h3> Ok cool bug, but will Discord fix it? </h3>

                <p>
                    Maybe. <span style="color: #E24C27">Maybe not.</span> When we stumbled upon it, after playing around with it trying to get something to break, 
                    we took a look at Twitter. <span style="color: #238737">Has anyone mentioned the bug before?</span>
                    I only found a handful of tweets regarding the <span style="color:#89c1f5;">Markdown</span> bug. It's interesting and fun to play with, 
                    but there isn't much real impact, apart from Flexxing your <span style="color: #F0E15A">master h4ck3r skills</span> to your friends. 
                    I would not be surprised if it was <span style="color: #E24C27">down last</span> on <span style="color: #E24C27">Discords </span> list of things to fix. 
                    It's interesting it hasn't spread much, this trick,
                    though after mentioning it to friends I did see it go around some servers a little bit. 
                    What I did not have the interest to find out was why on Mobile it didn't happen. On mobile it would only render as 50Message -- and continue from there onwards.
                    Perhaps CSS on mobile is significantly different..? Who knows.
